# Project Summary

As a data analyst for a music streaming platform, I have been tasked with analyzing their customer data and music purchasing trends to help the business make more informed decisions. The music streaming platform offers a wide range of musical genres and artists, and the company wants to better understand which genres and artists are the most popular among their customers, as well as which customers were most valuable in terms of their spending on music. I have been provided with a comprehensive dataset that include information about customers, their purchase history, the tracks they bought, the albums those tracks were from, and the artists who created those albums, employee data etc. Using this data, I will write SQL queries to uncover valuable insights that could help guide the marketing, content, and pricing strategies for the music streaming platform.
